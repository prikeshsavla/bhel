## Introduction
Bhel is a light and savoury snack from India, and a type of chaat. It is made of puffed rice, vegetables and a tangy tamarind sauce, and has a crunchy texture    
So a great food metaphor for excercising for individuals who want to loose weight.

## Features
- Added reliable workouts with music to give you a head start.
- Add, reorder and save unlimited new exercises, breaks and workouts.
- Play your own music  or play packaged music from [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/).
- See Stats of how much time spent exercising.
- Completely private, all the custom or generated workout data stored on your machine & nothing on a server.
